# Frutiger Aero Fish Tank

A beautiful and relaxing interactive fish tank simulation created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project captures the "Frutiger Aero" aesthetic, featuring glossy UI elements, vibrant colors, and a clean, optimistic design reminiscent of early 2000s software.

## Features

* **Frutiger Aero Design:** A visually rich experience with glossy buttons, vibrant gradients, and detailed, colorful fish that evoke the classic aesthetic.
* **Interactive Feeding:**
    * Click anywhere on the canvas to drop a single food pellet.
    * Click the "Drop Food Shower" button at the top to release a cascade of food for a feeding frenzy.
* **Realistic Fish Behavior:**
    * Fish will actively seek out the nearest food pellets.
    * After eating 3 pellets, a fish will feel "full" and enter a 5-second cooldown period before it gets hungry again.
* **Dynamic Animations:**
    * Fish swim with a natural bobbing motion.
    * Tails have a complex, fluid animation, combining horizontal and vertical sway for a more 3D effect.
    * Bubbles gently rise from the bottom, swaying realistically as they float up.
* **Responsive Design:** The fish tank automatically resizes to fit the browser window.
